## üîç Overview
This project implements a Pee-Wee OSPF (PWOSPF) router, a simplified version of the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) routing protocol. PWOSPF is designed as a link-state routing protocol that enables routers to dynamically discover network topology, compute optimal paths, and adapt to network changes in real-time.

The implementation builds upon a basic router framework to create a fully functional dynamic routing system that can:
* Automatically discover neighboring routers
* Exchange network topology information
* Compute optimal paths to destinations
* Handle network failures and recoveries
* Maintain routing tables dynamically

<summary><strong>Network Topology</strong></summary>

The project is developed and tested on a specific network topology consisting of three virtual PWOSPF routers (vhost1, vhost2, and vhost3) interconnected via subnets. This topology demonstrates the router's capability to handle dynamic route discovery, link failures, and network changes.

Key aspects of the topology:

* Each link represents a subnet, with two IP addresses (one for each end)
* All three routers (vhost1, vhost2, and vhost3) run the PWOSPF protocol
* The gateway provides connectivity to the internet (CS department network)
* Two servers act as end hosts for testing connectivity
* vhost1 connects to the gateway and serves as the internet access point
* Each router has multiple interfaces with specific IP/subnet configurations
* The topology allows testing of various scenarios including:
  * Dynamic route discovery
  * Link failure detection
  * Path recomputation
  * Network recovery

This topology is used for both development and testing, though IP assignments may differ during evaluation to ensure no hardcoding of addresses in the implementation.
