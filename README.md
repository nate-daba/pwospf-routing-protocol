## üîç Overview
This project implements a Pee-Wee OSPF (PWOSPF) router, a simplified version of the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) routing protocol. PWOSPF is designed as a link-state routing protocol that enables routers to dynamically discover network topology, compute optimal paths, and adapt to network changes in real-time.

The implementation builds upon a basic router framework to create a fully functional dynamic routing system that can:
* Automatically discover neighboring routers
* Exchange network topology information
* Compute optimal paths to destinations
* Handle network failures and recoveries
* Maintain routing tables dynamically

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

<details>
<summary><strong>Network Topology</strong></summary>

The project is developed and tested on a specific network topology consisting of three virtual PWOSPF routers (vhost1, vhost2, and vhost3) interconnected via subnets. This topology demonstrates the router's capability to handle dynamic route discovery, link failures, and network changes.

![Network Topology](images/113.png)

Key aspects of the topology:

* Each link represents a subnet, with two IP addresses (one for each end)
* All three routers (vhost1, vhost2, and vhost3) run the PWOSPF protocol
* The gateway provides connectivity to the internet (CS department network)
* Two servers act as end hosts for testing connectivity
* vhost1 connects to the gateway and serves as the internet access point
* Each router has multiple interfaces with specific IP/subnet configurations
* The topology allows testing of various scenarios including:
  * Dynamic route discovery
  * Link failure detection
  * Path recomputation
  * Network recovery

This topology is used for both development and testing, though IP assignments may differ during evaluation to ensure no hardcoding of addresses in the implementation.

## üöÄ Implementation Details

The PWOSPF router is implemented in several core components and data structures, primarily within **`sr_pwospf.c`** and its related headers. The design follows a simplified link-state protocol that enables routers to discover neighbors, exchange topology information, and perform shortest path calculations. Key aspects include:

1. **PWOSPF Subsystem**
   - Maintains a `pwospf_subsys` data structure, storing the local router‚Äôs interfaces, topology database, and protocol state (e.g., sequence numbers for Link State Updates).
   - Spawns a dedicated PWOSPF thread (`pwospf_run_thread()`) to handle periodic tasks such as sending HELLO messages, checking neighbor timeouts, and sending periodic LSUs.

2. **HELLO Protocol**
   - **`send_pwospf_hello()`** constructs and broadcasts HELLO packets to the multicast address `224.0.0.5`.
   - **`handle_pwospf_hello()`** processes incoming HELLO packets, updating or adding neighbors in the PWOSPF interface list.
   - Neighbor lifetimes are monitored, and inactive neighbors are removed automatically.

3. **Link State Updates (LSU)**
   - **`pwospf_send_lsu()`** builds and sends LSU packets containing the router‚Äôs local links, neighbor IDs, and optional default route advertisements.
   - **`pwospf_handle_lsu()`** processes incoming LSUs, updating the router‚Äôs topology database and flooding the updates where necessary.
   - Topology changes trigger immediate route recomputation.

4. **Topology & Routing**
   - The topology is stored as a linked list of `pwospf_router` structures, each with interfaces describing subnets and neighbor links.
   - **`bfs_shortest_paths()`** performs a BFS-based shortest path computation, updating or creating routing table entries accordingly.
   - **`recalculate_routing_table()`** orchestrates the BFS process, clearing stale routes and adding new ones for updated subnets.

5. **Neighbor & Interface Management**
   - Each `pwospf_interface` tracks a single neighbor (for simplicity), storing its IP address and the last time a HELLO packet was received.
   - **`pwospf_check_on_neighbors()`** periodically checks for timed-out neighbors, removing them from the topology and triggering an LSU if necessary.

6. **Static Routes & Gateway**
   - **`read_static_routes()`** scans the initial routing table for default or static routes, marking the router as a gateway if a default route is found.
   - Gateway routers advertise `0.0.0.0/0` in their LSUs to inform others of a default path.

With these components, the system provides a complete yet simplified OSPF-like environment that adapts to network changes on the fly.


## üß™ Testing and Validation

This project includes a script (**`test.sh`**) that verifies correct behavior under various scenarios. The tests aim to validate the PWOSPF router‚Äôs functionality, including route discovery, neighbor timeouts, link-state flooding, and end-to-end connectivity checks.

First, ssh into the server you want to run software router on.

```bash
ssh <username>@<server_ip>
```

Next, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nate-daba/pwospf-routing-protocol.git
cd pwospf-routing-protocol/pwospf_stub
```

Then follow the steps below to start the routers and run automated tests:

1. **Starting the Routers**
   - Open three separate ssh connections to the server and run the following commands to start the routers:

      - **Router 1 (vhost1) on ssh connection 1**:
        ```bash
        ./sr -t 113 -v vhost1 -r rtable.net
        ```
      - **Router 2 (vhost2) on ssh connection 2**:
        ```bash
        ../sr -t 113 -v vhost2 -r rtable.empty
        ```
      - **Router 3 (vhost3) on ssh connection 3**:
        ```bash
        ../sr -t 113 -v vhost3 -r rtable.empty
        ```
    

2. **Running Automated Tests**  
   - Use the **`-t`** option to specify a topology number. For example:
     ```bash
     ./test.sh -t 113
     ```
   - The script will look for a file named `vnltopo1.iplist` (or `vnltopoX.iplist`) containing IP assignments for the routers, servers, and gateway in that topology.

2. **Script Workflow**  
   1. **Ping Testing**  
      - For each IP address found in the `iplist` file (e.g., `ip_server1_eth0`, `ip_server2_eth0`, etc.), the script executes a series of pings (`ping -c 5`) to verify reachability.  
      - Successful replies confirm basic IP connectivity through the PWOSPF router.
   2. **HTTP Download**  
      - If server IPs are present, it attempts a file download (`wget http://SERVER_IP:16280/64MB.bin`) from both servers, ensuring TCP paths are established and traffic flows through the router.
   3. **Inter-Server Pings**  
      - The script then instructs each server to ping the other, validating that routes are correctly established in both directions.

3. **Validation Criteria**  
   - **Neighbor Discovery**: HELLO messages must be exchanged successfully, and neighbors appear in the topology.
   - **Route Computation**: Both direct and default routes are inserted correctly, and BFS-based computations generate minimal or optimal paths.
   - **Failure Handling**: If a link or neighbor times out, the routing table should converge to an updated valid state, and LSUs should propagate the topology change.
   - **Stability Under Load**: Download tests (`wget`) verify that standard TCP flows remain stable and are properly routed.

4. **Interpreting Test Results**  
   - **Ping Outputs**: Consistent `0% packet loss` indicates valid paths. Failure implies a missing or incorrect route.  
   - **Download Results**: Any HTTP file retrieval success from servers behind the router further validates end-to-end connectivity.  
   - **Server-to-Server**: If servers can ping each other via the PWOSPF router(s), multi-hop routing is confirmed functional.

By following these tests and verifying logs, pings, and routing-table outputs, you can ensure the PWOSPF router meets all major requirements set forth in the project specification.
